#+TITLE:AEON (Another Emacs Operating eNvironment) Introduction and Initialization
#+AUTHOR:Joshua Suskalo
#+PROPERTY: header-args:emacs-lisp :session *emacs-config-session*

* Rationale
  AEON is a literate config for emacs, built around modularity and ease of use.


* Architecture
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args: :noweb no-export :tangle no
  :END:
  AEON follows a modular architecture, such that -- aside from some core configurations --
  anything can be included or excluded as desired.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle yes
    <<core-emacs-configuration>>
  #+END_SRC

** Initialization
*** Core Appearance and Usability
    Right when emacs is first started, some basic configuration needs to be set.
    That will help ensure that some of the core experience working with it is pleasant.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :noweb-ref core-emacs-configuration
      (setq user-full-name "Joshua Suskalo"
            user-mail-address "joshua@suskalo.org")

      (global-font-lock-mode t)

      (setq initial-scratch-message ";; Hello, world!")
    #+END_SRC
